    <string name="cs_name_1">Sir Tim Berners Lee</string>  
	<string name="cs_desc_1">
	    Educated at Queens College, Oxford, Sir Tim Berners Lee moved into the field of computer science almost immediately 
	    upon receiving his physics degree and is widely known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. 
	    In 1989 Lee implemented the first successful communication between an HTTP client and server via what would become HTML. 
	    Lee helped invent and implement the language of the WWW, and his continued contributions have been significant as 
	    he continues to provide important input today on the still-growing infrastructure.

	<string name="cs_name_2">Linus Torvalds</string>
	<string name="cs_desc_2">
	    This Finnish/American engineer graduated from the University of Helsinki, and then invented a Unix operating system 
	    flavor which became Linux, one of the most widely used operating systems in the world. Linux hasnâ€™t seen much growth 
	    in the consumer market, but has been a mainstay for programmers for decades. Most of the internet runs on Linux servers, 
	    the trademark of which is incredible stability, and strong security. Torvalds continues his work, sponsored by the Linux 
	    foundation, and his continued contributions to the Linux platform have continued to change computing for everybody, 
	    albeit behind the scenes.
